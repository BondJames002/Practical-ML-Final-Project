# Practical-ML-Final-Project
Final assignment of Johns Hopkins for Practical ML course

The results of the final test for Practical Machine Learning is included here. The goal is to predict whether new weight lifters are doing their exercises correctly based on readings from on-body meters. This could be an advanced real time AI application that becomes a virtual instructor and perpetual assistant for beginners and experts alike. 
While the labeled training set was created under simulated conditions the fitness experts involved confirm they cover the range or proper and improper execution of the weight lifting exercise.
